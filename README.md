Vr Bow and arrow game ... on horseback yeah!
# Pitch
A Vr bow and arrow game where the terrain is procedurally generated and the character is predominently on horseback.  The player "guides" the horse through various terrains (desert, mountain passes, wide open plains) while fighting off attacking rival tribes.  The player has a sacred bow that releases infinite energy arrows. Players can search for indian talismans hidden throughout the map to enhance the bows powers.  The player also has a 6 shooter pistol to use sparingly.  The bow also has a kind of energy field, that acts as a sheld to repel oncoming attacks.

At nightfall, the enemies become more challenging and creatures possesed by the main antagonist, a powerful shaman ... a "skin walker".  He has the power to posses animals, and turn them into zombies.  These animals attack the player at random intervals.  Along with the night animals the player must fend off attacks from the "Ghost Riders".   These are Indian braves that have traded their free will to the Skinwalker in order to be immortal.

Your Horse also changes into a "Spirit Animal" at night with various skills and perks.

The goal is to guide the Horse to the hidden lair of the SKinwalker shaman, kill him, and lift your own progressing curse.
